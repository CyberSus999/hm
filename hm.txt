SPF(Sender Policy Framework) 
What is SPF?
---It is an email authentication  method that helps prrevent email spoofing
+application - email systems
+authentication - when the  the recieving server checks the sender's ip address against the SPF record in the domain's DNS, the result should have an "SPF:PASS" tag in the email headers. If not it is not authenticated. This also proves authenticity
-Examples - 1.SPF:FAIL. This indicates an unauthorized server sent the email.
			2.SPF:NONE. This indicates the that the domain lacks an SPF record hence cannot verify the sender
DKIM(Domain Keys Identified Mail)
What is it?
--it is an email authentication method that uses crptographic signatures for verification.
+authentication - A digital signature is added to the email header and checked for against a public key in the sender's DNS records. A "DKIM:PASS" tag is the results in the email hearder if authentic. If not it should be flagged as suspicious.
-Examples - DKIM:Fail. Cryptographic signature does not match public key 
		  - DKIM:None. There is no DKIM signature to verify
DMARC(Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance)
What is it?
--An email authentication method that builds on SPF and DKIm
+authentication - It allows domain owners to specify policies that screen unauthenticated emails.There should be a DMARC:PASS tag in email headers to prove authenticity
-Example - DMARC:FAIL. When the email fails SPF or DKIM checks and does not align with DMARC policies, it will get flaaged as suspicious
		 - DMARC:NONE. When the sender's domain lacks in DMARC policy in DNS. 
 -Phishing - Is a technique where by an attacker baits thier target with a malicious link to steal senstive data
